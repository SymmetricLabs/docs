## Overview

The Tessa Workflow API uses API key authentication to secure all endpoints. Each API key is associated with a specific user account and provides access only to that user's workflows and runs.

## Getting Your API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Dashboard">
    Log into your Tessa dashboard to manage your API keys.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate API Key">
    Navigate to the API Keys section and generate a new key for your application.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Store your API key securely and never expose it in client-side code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.heytessa.ai/v1/get_workflow_details" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## API Key Security

<Warning>
  **Keep your API keys secure!** Never expose them in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**: Store API keys in environment variables
- **Secure Storage**: Use secure key management systems in production
- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate your API keys
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

### Example Environment Setup

```bash
# .env file
TESSA_API_KEY=sk_test_1234567890abcdef
```

```python
# Python example
import os
import requests

api_key = os.getenv('TESSA_API_KEY')
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.heytessa.ai/v1/get_workflow_details',
    headers=headers
)
```

## Authentication Errors

### Invalid API Key (401)

```json
{
  "detail": "Invalid API key"
}
```

### Inactive API Key (401)

```json
{
  "detail": "API key is inactive"
}
```

### Missing Authorization Header (401)

```json
{
  "detail": "Not authenticated"
}
```

## API Key Management

### Key States

- **Active**: Key is valid and can be used for API requests
- **Inactive**: Key has been disabled and cannot be used
- **Revoked**: Key has been permanently deleted

### Key Permissions

Each API key provides access to:

- ✅ User's workflows and workflow details
- ✅ Starting and stopping user's workflows
- ✅ Viewing user's workflow runs and status
- ✅ Deleting user's workflow runs
- ❌ Other users' data (strict isolation)
- ❌ Administrative functions

<Note>
  API keys are scoped to individual users and cannot access data belonging to other users.
