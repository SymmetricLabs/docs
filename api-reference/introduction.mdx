## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using API keys. Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  API keys are tied to specific users and provide access only to workflows and runs belonging to that user.
</Warning>

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Health check**: 10 requests per minute

- **Start workflow**: 10 requests per minute
- **Stop workflow**: 20 requests per minute
- **Get runs**: 30 requests per minute
- **Get status**: 60 requests per minute

All API responses follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "status": "success|error",
  "message": "Human readable message",
  "data": {
    // Response data object
