The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage and maintain system stability. Rate limits are applied per API key and are enforced across all endpoints.

### Current Rate Limits

The following rate limits are applied to different API endpoints:

- **Health check**: 10 requests per minute
- **Workflow details**: 30 requests per minute  
- **Start workflow**: 10 requests per minute
- **Stop workflow**: 20 requests per minute
- **Get runs**: 30 requests per minute
- **Get status**: 60 requests per minute
- **Delete run**: 20 requests per minute

### Understanding Rate Limits

- Rate limits are calculated on a rolling window basis
- Each API key has its own quota
- Limits are enforced per endpoint
- Exceeding rate limits will result in a `429 Too Many Requests` response

### Best Practices

1. **Implement Exponential Backoff**: If you receive a 429 response, wait before retrying
2. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of your API usage to avoid hitting limits
3. **Batch Requests**: When possible, combine multiple requests into a single call
4. **Cache Responses**: Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls

### Handling Rate Limits

When you hit a rate limit, the API will return:
```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "Too many requests",
  "retry_after": 60
}
```

The `retry_after` field indicates the number of seconds you should wait before making another request.
