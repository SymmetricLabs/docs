The dashboard provides a clean, intuitive interface where you can view your current workflows, run new workflows, and access key features like sandbox and integrations.

### Home
The home page is where you can manipulate all of your workflows:
- View all your workflows in one place
- Start new workflows that you have previously created
- Create entirely new workflows with ease
- Cancel, restart or delete curredntly active workflows
- View all the different workflows that you had previously run

### Sandbox
The Sandbox is your personal testing environment where you can:
- Start new sessions to interact with Tessa directly
- Use natural language to describe tasks
- Work with various file types (PDFs, spreadsheets, images)
- Test features like web navigation, email management, and data processing
- Experiment safely without affecting production workflows

### Integrations
Tessa seamlessly connects with popular productivity tools:
- Google Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Calendar, Docs, Sheets)
- Microsoft 365 (Outlook, OneDrive, Teams, SharePoint)
- Communication tools like Slack

All integrations are secured through OAuth authentication to protect your data.

## Workflows
You can click on the first tile in the workflow grid labeled "Create New Workflow", upon which you'll enter a new page where you can create your own custom workflow!

### Creating a new workflow
- You can add new nodes using the 'Add Node' section at the top left. There are two types of nodes:
  - **Directive Node**: Use natural language to convey what you want the AI to do, just like you're talking to another human!
  - **Action Node**: if you're feeling more tech-savvy, you can provide JSON inputs for the AI to follow
- You can edit, delete and move around the nodes as you please and connect the nodes to each other in an intuitive manner

### Editing an existing workflow
Once you're happy with your workflow, you can:
- **Name**: Give your workflow a descriptive title to easily identify it later
- **Save**: Store your workflow configuration for future use
- **Run**: Execute the workflow immediately to process your data
- **Schedule**: Set up automated runs at specific times or intervals
- **Duplicate**: Create a copy of your workflow to use as a template for variations

### Viewing past workflows
- **Version History**: See how you have modified your workflow over time
- **Run History**: Examine all the different times you've run the workflow

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter and their solutions:
- **Workflow Not Starting**: Check your API key and ensure you have the correct permissions. Verify that all required parameters are provided in the correct format.
- **Node Connection Errors**: Make sure all nodes are properly connected and that the output of one node matches the expected input of the next node.
- **Authentication Failures**: Verify your OAuth credentials are valid and haven't expired. Re-authenticate if necessary.
